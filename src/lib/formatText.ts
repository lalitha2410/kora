/**
 * The system prompt asks the model to use WhatsApp's *single-asterisk*
 * bold convention instead of markdown's **double-asterisk** — but a small
 * model doesn't follow formatting instructions with 100% consistency, and
 * ChatBubble renders plain text with no markdown parser, so any stray
 * markdown shows up literally on screen. Same principle as the pricing
 * policy engine (src/lib/pricingPolicy.ts): the model converses, code
 * enforces.
 *
 * Three passes, in order, each fixing a case the previous version (a
 * single lazy double-asterisk pair match, no dotAll flag) missed:
 *
 * 1. A line-leading "* " is a markdown list bullet, not emphasis —
 *    collapse it to a plain bullet first. Otherwise a bulleted, bolded
 *    label like "* **Discount:**" becomes "* *Discount:*" after the
 *    bold pass: a bullet asterisk sitting right next to an emphasis
 *    asterisk, which reads as a run of stray stars even though each one
 *    is individually "correct".
 * 2. Collapse a run of 3+ asterisks (markdown's bold-italic combo) down to
 *    a plain pair first. The old regex left these half-converted — the
 *    outer pair got consumed but a literal double-asterisk was left over,
 *    never touched again.
 * 3. Collapse double-asterisk pairs to single, now matching across line
 *    breaks. Previously, a bold span whose closing marker landed on a
 *    later line (the model wrapping a whole multi-line block in one bold
 *    run) never matched at all — both markers stayed literal on screen.
 *    The match is still lazy, so well-formed same-line pairs are
 *    unaffected; this only adds the ability to close spans that would
 *    otherwise never resolve.
